## :hatched_chick:Getting started

2. Type to search for applications
3. Use arrow keys to navigate between suggestions

### Configuration

KASURI settings can be easily configured from the in-app **Settings Screen**.

To open the Settings Screen, right-click the KASURI icon in the system tray and select "Settings" from the menu.

- You can intuitively change major settings such as hotkey, window width, auto startup, log level, application search paths, and application aliases via the GUI.
- Changes are applied immediately (some items may require a restart).
- There is no need to edit the `settings.toml` file directly.

### System Tray Menu Items

- **Settings**: Opens the settings window where you can configure hotkey, window width, auto startup, log level, application search paths, and application aliases.
- **Reload**: Reloads the application cache (e.g., re-scans for applications). Use this if you have installed or removed applications and want to update the list.
- **Open Log Directory**: Opens the folder where log files are stored. Useful for troubleshooting or checking logs.
- **Exit**: Exits KASURI completely.

## :chicken:FAQ



### How do I change the hotkey?

You can change the hotkey from the Settings Screen. The format follows the [Tauri global shortcut](https://tauri.app/v1/api/js/globalShortcut/) convention.



### How do I set an alias for an application?

You can add application aliases from the "Application Aliases" section in the Settings Screen. Once set, you can search for the application using either its original name or the alias.



### Why doesn't KASURI find some of my applications?

KASURI searches for applications in the directories specified in the Settings Screen. Please make sure all necessary directories are included in your configuration.



### How can I make KASURI launch on startup?

Enable the "Auto Startup" option in the Settings Screen.



### Where are my settings stored?

Settings are stored internally in `%APPDATA%\Local\KASURI\settings.toml`, but you should normally use the Settings Screen for all configuration.

### Where are log files stored?

Log files are stored in the `logs` directory within the application installation folder. The application automatically creates this directory if it doesn't exist.
