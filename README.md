## :hatched_chick:Getting started


1. Press your configured hotkey (default is Alt+Space) to open the launcher
2. Type to search for applications
3. Use arrow keys to navigate between suggestions
4. Press Enter to launch the selected application

### Configuration

Settings can be configured in `settings.toml` located in the KASURI application data directory:

- `shortcut_key`: Global hotkey to open the launcher
- `width`: Width of the launcher window
- `auto_startup`: Whether to start KASURI when Windows starts
- `log_level`: Logging verbosity (error, warn, info, debug)
- `application_search_path_list`: Directories to search for applications
- `application_search_interval_on_startup_minute`: How often to refresh the application cache

## :chicken:FAQ

### How do I change the hotkey?

Edit the `shortcut_key` setting in the `settings.toml` file. The format follows the [Tauri global shortcut](https://tauri.app/v1/api/js/globalShortcut/) convention.

### Why doesn't KASURI find some of my applications?

KASURI searches for applications in the directories specified in `application_search_path_list`. Make sure all your application directories are included.

### How can I make KASURI launch on startup?

Set `auto_startup = true` in your `settings.toml` file.

### Where are my settings stored?

Settings are stored in `%APPDATA%\Local\KASURI\settings.toml`.
